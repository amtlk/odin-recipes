    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely grated raw horseradish (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef, mushrooms, onion, and garlic. Saute until beef is browned
            and crumbly, 6 to 8 minutes. Add flour; cook and stir until combined, about 2 minutes. Add broth, cream of
            mushroom soup, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Simmer, stirring
            occasionally, until flavors blend, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a
            boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes.
            Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine sour cream and horseradish in a bowl; add to the beef mixture. Stir. Cook until hot, about 5
            minutes. Serve over hot cooked egg noodles.
        </li>
    </ol>
